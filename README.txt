DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
---------------------


1. File List


   A. google_form_data_raw.csv: 

We used a Google form to create a de-identified dataset with reproducibility scores and additional information for each study. We analyzed reproducibility in three ways: (1) whether the numbers cited in the tables and/or text matched our numbers, allowing for rounding error within the publication's significant digits; (2) whether the original figures matched our reproduced figures, accounting for variation in the exact format of the figure; and (3) whether the conclusions cited by the original study's authors were supported, regardless of whether specific numerical results matched or not. We ranked these criteria on a five-point scale with 5 being totally reproducible and 1 being completely unreproducible (Table 1). We focused on these three reproducibility criteria with the idea that even if specific effect sizes may have varied, the most important aspect of reproducibility would be to match the ultimate conclusions, which in TWS journals are often used to make management recommendations. To limit subjective bias in our reproducibility scoring, a second reviewer read through the reproducibility notes and scored the study. The overall reproducibility scores for each paper were the averages of the two reviewer's scores. 
        
   B. 01_data_processing.html: 

Complete R code (R Core Team 2015) to take the raw Google Form data and get it ready for subsequent analyses and figures. Processing steps included re-classifying some categorical data and renaming columns.

   C. 02_study_overview_figure.html: 

Complete R code (R Core Team 2015) to calculate the numbers used to produce Figure 1 in the manuscript draft. The manuscript was produced with Adobe Illustrator.

   D. 03_scores_by_journal_figure.html: 

Complete R code (R Core Team 2015) to create Figure 2 in the manuscript. This script takes the processed data and reorganizes it into the format for ggplot. This script ultimately creates the figure (.png) used in the manuscript. 

   E. 04_reproducibility_criteria_figure.html: 

Complete R code (R Core Team 2015) to create Figure 3 in the manuscript. This script takes the processed data and reorganizes it into the format for ggplot. This script ultimately creates the figure (.png) used in the manuscript. 

   F. R_scripts.zip:
   
Complete Program R files (.R extension) for each of the above .html files. 




2. Relationship between files:        

Each html file (items B through E) uses the raw data (and then processed data) to create results and figures for the manuscript. The script in 01_processing_data.html should be run first before any other subsequent scripts can be run. Scripts found in items C, D, and E can be run interchangeably. The zipped folder (item K) contains all of the Program R files (.R extension) for each of the html files.


3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: Our raw data collected for the reviewing process is considered confidential and will not be released. 

4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? 

The same data and scripts are available for download and use on GitHub (https://github.com/aaarchmiller/reproducibility_in_wildlife_ecology).


--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

For complete methodological details, please refer to ArchMiller et al., Computational reproducibility in The Wildlife Society's flagship journals. In short, we attempted to computationally reproduce 80 published articles from The Journal of Wildlife Management and The Wildlife Society Bulletin. For each article, we filled out a Google Form survey with de-identified information, which became the dataset shared on this repository. The scripts then take that data and create the results and figures that we include in the manuscript. 

2. Methods for processing the data: 

Processing the data included re-classifying some categorical data, changing column header names, and calculating average reproducibility scores. Code for processing can be found in 01_processing_data.html.

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:

Programs were written for Program R (R Core Team 2015) and full session information, including packages used, are provided at the bottom of each html file. 

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: NA

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: NA

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: All programs and data have been extensively reviewed for quality assurance and control. 

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: Althea ArchMiller, Andrew Johnson, Jane Nolan
